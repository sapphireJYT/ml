# Machine Learning

- Simple binary classification: 
    - Majority classifier 
    - Even/Odd classifier
  
- Logistic Rregression classifier 
    - AdaGrad: adaptively alter learning rates
  
- Support Vector Machine 
    - Pegasos: Primal Estimated sub-GrAdient SOlver for SVM
  
- Gradient based learning for Restricted Boltzmann Machine 
    - use EM for learning
  
- Loopy Belief Propagation for loopy MRF calculation
  
- Approximate Inference on RBM 
    - based on Stochastic Sampling
